# Decision-Boundary-for-Logistic-Regression
## Visualizing Data and Decision Boundaries

This code snippet demonstrates the visualization of data points and decision boundaries using Matplotlib in Python. 

### 1. Data Visualization:
The provided dataset consists of two features, \( x_0 \) and \( x_1 \), along with corresponding binary labels. The data points are plotted on a scatter plot, with \( x_0 \) on the x-axis and \( x_1 \) on the y-axis.

### 2. Sigmoid Function Visualization:
The sigmoid function is plotted over a range of values from -10 to 10, showcasing its characteristic S-shaped curve. This function is commonly used in logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome.

### 3. Decision Boundary Plot:
A decision boundary is defined using a linear equation. This boundary is represented as a straight line on the plot, separating the regions corresponding to different classes. The region below the decision boundary is filled to visually distinguish between the two classes.

### 4. Final Visualization:
The original data points are overlaid on the plot to visualize how they relate to the decision boundary. Both the data points and the decision boundary plot are saved as image files for further reference or inclusion in reports/documentation.

This code snippet provides a clear visual representation of decision boundaries and demonstrates how they can be used to classify data points in a binary classification problem.
